### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a âœ¨ Java Full Stack Developer âœ¨ with over 10 years of experience participating in the complete product development lifecycle of successfully launched applications. I have hands-on professional experience in Java, J2EE, Spring (Boot, Cloud, Security, WS), Hibernate/JPA, JavaScript, React, Angular, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Oracle, AWS, Microservices, RESTful & SOAP API development, etc.

ðŸ”­ In my previous roles, migrated monolithic applications into microservices, developed greenfield products using cloud-native and microservice architecture, refactored code base to increase maintainability, and resolved a performance bottleneck that increased application performance. I also implemented hundreds of different integrations: JWT, OAuth, HL7, FHIR, Zoho CRM, eBay API, Amazon S3, Twilio, QuickBooks, Authorize.net, HubSpot, etc.
