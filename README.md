### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a âœ¨ Java full stack developer âœ¨ with 10+ years of experience participating in web and Android mobile applications. I have hands-on professional experience in Java, J2EE, Spring (Boot, Cloud, Security, WS), Hibernate/JPA, JavaScript, React, Angular, HTML/CSS, SQL, Kubernetes, Docker, Git, CI/CD, DevOps, AWS, etc.

Especially, I have been specializing in back-end development for the last 7 years, focusing my career around providing solutions for financial systems that have given me a deep understanding of how to create systems that can handle concurrent requests, big loads of work, are reconcilable and can recover from catastrophic events.
