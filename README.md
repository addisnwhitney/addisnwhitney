## About Me

I've been working with websites for more than 10 years as a Full Stack JavaScript Developer, focusing on React and Node.js. I'm good at making websites look cool and work smoothly. I've also learned a lot about databases and building APIs that can handle a lot of stuff.

Besides the technical stuff, I'm great at working with a team. I like talking to my teammates, using tools like Git to manage our code, and making sure we all understand what we're doing. I use tools like Slack and Jira to keep everything organized, and I'm always ready to share ideas and help the team reach our goals.
